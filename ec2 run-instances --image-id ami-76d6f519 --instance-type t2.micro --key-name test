[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Launches  the  specified number of instances using an AMI for which you
       have permissions.

       You can specify a number of options, or leave the default options.  The
       following rules apply:

       +o [EC2-VPC]  If you don't specify a subnet ID, we choose a default sub-
         net from your default VPC for you. If you don't have a  default  VPC,
         you must specify a subnet ID in the request.

       +o [EC2-Classic]  If  don't  specify an Availability Zone, we choose one
         for you.

       +o Some instance types must be launched into a VPC. If you do not have a
         default VPC, or if you do not specify a subnet ID, the request fails.
         For more information, see [4mInstance[24m [4mtypes[24m [4mavailable[24m [4monly[24m [4min[24m [4ma[24m [4mVPC[24m .

       +o [EC2-VPC] All instances have a network interface with a primary  pri-
         vate  IPv4  address. If you don't specify this address, we choose one
         from the IPv4 range of your subnet.

       +o Not all instance types support IPv6 addresses. For more  information,
         see [4mInstance[24m [4mtypes[24m .

       +o If you don't specify a security group ID, we use the default security
         group. For more information, see [4mSecurity[24m [4mgroups[24m .

       +o If any of the AMIs have a product code attached for  which  the  user
         has not subscribed, the request fails.

       You  can  create  a [4mlaunch[24m [4mtemplate[24m , which is a resource that contains
       the parameters to launch an instance. When you launch an instance using
       RunInstances  , you can specify the launch template instead of specify-
       ing the launch parameters.

       To ensure faster  instance  launches,  break  up  large  requests  into
       smaller  batches. For example, create five separate launch requests for
       100 instances each instead of one launch request for 500 instances.

       An instance is ready for you to use when it's in the [1mrunning [22mstate. You
       can check the state of your instance using  DescribeInstances . You can
       tag instances and EBS volumes during launch, after launch, or both. For
       more information, see  CreateTags and [4mTagging[24m [4myour[24m [4mAmazon[24m [4mEC2[24m [4mresources[0m
       .

       Linux instances have access to the public key of the key pair at  boot.
       You  can  use this key to provide secure access to the instance. Amazon
       EC2 public images use this feature to  provide  secure  access  without
       passwords. For more information, see [4mKey[24m [4mpairs[24m .

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       [1m--block-device-mappings [22m(list)
          The block device mapping, which defines the EBS volumes and instance
          store volumes to attach to the instance at launch. For more informa-
          tion, see [4mBlock[24m [4mdevice[24m [4mmappings[24m in the [4mAmazon[24m [4mEC2[24m [4mUser[24m [4mGuide[24m .

          (structure)
              Describes a block device mapping, which defines the EBS  volumes
              and instance store volumes to attach to an instance at launch.

              DeviceName -> (string)
                 The device name (for example, [1m/dev/sdh [22mor [1mxvdh [22m).

              VirtualName -> (string)
                 The virtual device name ([1mephemeral [22mN). Instance store volumes
                 are numbered starting from 0. An instance type with 2  avail-
                 able   instance   store  volumes  can  specify  mappings  for
                 [1mephemeral0 [22mand [1mephemeral1 [22m. The number of available  instance
                 store volumes depends on the instance type. After you connect
                 to the instance, you must mount the volume.

                 NVMe instance store volumes are automatically enumerated  and
                 assigned  a  device name. Including them in your block device
                 mapping has no effect.

                 Constraints: For M3  instances,  you  must  specify  instance
                 store  volumes  in the block device mapping for the instance.
                 When you launch an M3 instance, we ignore any instance  store
                 volumes specified in the block device mapping for the AMI.

              Ebs -> (structure)
                 Parameters  used to automatically set up EBS volumes when the
                 instance is launched.

                 DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether the EBS volume is deleted  on  instance
                     termination.  For more information, see [4mPreserving[24m [4mAmazon[0m

                 Iops -> (integer)
                     The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS). For [1mgp3 [22m,
                     [1mio1 [22m, and [1mio2 [22mvolumes, this represents the number of IOPS
                     that  are  provisioned  for  the volume. For [1mgp2 [22mvolumes,
                     this represents the baseline performance  of  the  volume
                     and  the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O credits
                     for bursting.

                     The following are the supported values  for  each  volume
                     type:

                     +o [1mgp3 [22m: 3,000-16,000 IOPS
